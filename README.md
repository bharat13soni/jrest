# jrest
# JSON + RESTful = JRest Is a Meta programming language which converts the intentions of data access and manipulation against a database table in the form of SQL statement into key based RESTful service.  JRest makes a complete departure from the standards of the RESTful services, as there are no URI to publish by the user! Entire JRest revolves around three types of URIs, /login, /pull, /push.
